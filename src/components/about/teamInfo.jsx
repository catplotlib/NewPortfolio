        Hey I am Puja. I am a front-end developer and I love building
        state-of-the-art, easy to use, user-friendly websites. I live and
        breathe react, and have several projects in my portfolio that would
        suggest the same.I have an in-depth knowledge of modern react components
        like Hooks and Babel and have experience working with several react
        libraries like material-UI etc. I have also experience in node.js,
        express.js and MongoDB and have made a few projects with these tech
        stacks as well. I like to think of myself as a ambitious person who just
        loves to code and develop.
